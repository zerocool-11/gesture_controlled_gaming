### it's nothing unique but quite awesome...   
### In order to use this code you just have to run the hand_track.py file, after that keep your hand in position in front of camera it will capture the frame after that highlight your left hand fist by using cursor and press enter after highlighting the part same for the right hand 

### now simply place your hand in front of camera now remember your left hand if forward and backward or you can say its for accelerate and brake  and right hand is for steering (left and right)
